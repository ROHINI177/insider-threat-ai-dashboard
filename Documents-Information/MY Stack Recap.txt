# Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
React (Runs on localhost:3000)

What it is: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Why it's used:

Lets you build dynamic, component-based UIs.

React efficiently updates and renders UI based on state changes (ideal for real-time dashboards).

Works well with modern JavaScript tools and integrates easily with backend APIs.

Tailwind CSS

What it is: A utility-first CSS framework for fast UI styling.

Why it's used:

Helps build responsive, clean, and modern interfaces without writing custom CSS.

You can design directly in your HTML/JSX using utility classes (bg-blue-500, p-4, etc.).

Speeds up frontend development with consistent design patterns.


Backend: FastAPI
FastAPI (Runs on localhost:8000)

What it is: A high-performance Python web framework for building APIs.

Why it's used:

It's fast, easy to write, and comes with automatic docs (/docs) using Swagger.

Perfect for real-time API requests (e.g., send behavior logs, fetch alerts, get risk scores).

Natively supports asynchronous programming for better performance with high traffic.



Database: PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL

What it is: A powerful open-source relational database.

Why it's used:

Stores user data, behavior logs, risk scores, and more in a structured format.

Supports complex queries, indexing, and is very reliable.

Works well with FastAPI through libraries like SQLAlchemy or async drivers.



Log Simulator: Kafka-style Script (Python)
Kafka-style Log Simulator

What it is: A Python script that mimics real-time log generation and streaming like Kafka.

Why it's used:

Simulates live user activity (e.g., login, file access, data transfers) sent to the backend.

Mimics behavior of enterprise log streams like Kafka without needing a full Kafka setup.

Lets you test and visualize real-time data in the dashboard.


What is Kafka?
‚û§ Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps.
 Think of Kafka like a messaging system, but built for high speed and scale.
It collects, stores, and distributes real-time data between systems.

It‚Äôs often used in big companies like LinkedIn, Netflix, Uber to handle millions of events per second.

| Term         | What it Means                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Producer** | Sends data (e.g., logs, events) to Kafka.              |
| **Consumer** | Reads data from Kafka.                                 |
| **Broker**   | A Kafka server that handles storage and data exchange. |
| **Topic**    | A category or stream name for organizing data.         |
| **Message**  | A single piece of data (like a log line).              |

Example Use Case
Imagine you're tracking activity in a company:

A producer sends user actions (like login, file access) to Kafka.

Kafka stores them in a topic called user_activity.

A consumer, like your FastAPI backend, listens to this topic and processes or stores the data.


| Feature              | Why it‚Äôs Useful                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ‚ö° High Speed         | Handles **millions of events per second**.                   |
| üîÑ Real-time         | Data flows through Kafka **immediately** as it's generated.  |
| üìÅ Durable           | Data is saved to disk‚Äî**not lost** on restart.               |
| üîß Scalable          | Can scale easily across multiple servers.                    |
| üîÅ Decoupled Systems | Producers and consumers don‚Äôt need to know about each other. |
