🔐 1. AI-Powered Insider Threat Detection Dashboard
🧠 One-liner:
A cybersecurity analytics platform that uses AI to detect unusual user behavior and prevent insider threats in remote teams.

🎯 Real-world use case:
As remote work increases, so does internal data leakage. This tool helps SMBs monitor digital behavior anomalies (like unusual file downloads or login patterns) to detect threats early.

🧰 Tech Stack:

Frontend: React + D3.js for behavioral heatmaps and anomaly graphs

Backend: Python (FastAPI)

Data Pipeline: Apache Kafka + PostgreSQL or Snowflake

ML/AI: PyOD, Isolation Forest, LSTM anomaly detection

Infra: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (Kinesis, S3, CloudWatch), GitHub Actions

💡 Advanced Features:

Behavioral anomaly detection using time-series patterns

Live dashboards showing risk scores per user

Slack/Email alerts on detected threat behavior

Role-based access control and full audit logs

Automatic retraining of models with new behavior logs

📌 Resume Pitch:
“Built an AI-driven anomaly detection platform for internal security using Kafka pipelines, LSTM models, and interactive dashboards—flagging insider threats before they escalate.”

🚀 Why it's unique:
Goes beyond login/auth to tackle internal security using real behavioral ML, addressing a rising concern in modern businesses.

🔄 Phase 1: Project Architecture & Planning
✅ Step 1: Define Scope and MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Your MVP will include:

User activity ingestion system (simulated initially)

Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest

Backend APIs (FastAPI) to serve user risk scores

Frontend (React + D3.js) for dashboard visualization

Slack/email alerts for flagged behavior

Let’s focus on "detecting login/download anomalies for simulated users" first, then expand.



🧱 Phase 2: Project Setup
✅ Step 2: Set Up GitHub Repo & Directory Structure
Create a repo called: insider-threat-ai-dashboard

Suggested structure:


insider-threat-ai-dashboard/
├── backend/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   ├── ml/
│   │   └── main.py
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── requirements.txt
├── frontend/
│   ├── public/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── App.js
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── package.json
├── kafka-simulator/
│   ├── producer.py
├── docker-compose.yml
├── README.md
└── .env



⚙️ Phase 3: Backend (FastAPI + ML)
✅ Step 3: FastAPI Backend
Expose API to get user behavior and risk score

CRUD endpoints for users (add/remove/test)

/api/users, /api/behavior, /api/anomalies




✅ Step 4: ML Anomaly Detection
Start with:

Isolation Forest to flag abnormal login/download frequency

Later add LSTM to track temporal sequences

Use PyOD for anomaly scoring

✅ Step 5: Simulate Behavior Logs
Use Kafka:

Python script that sends logs (user_id, timestamp, action, file_size, ip_address)

Simulate spikes or abnormal logins for some users


🌐 Phase 4: Frontend (React + D3.js)
✅ Step 6: Dashboard UI
Pages:

User Risk Overview: Table of users + risk scores

Heatmap of actions by time

Anomaly timeline per user

Tech:

D3.js for heatmaps and time-series

Axios to call FastAPI endpoints

React Router + Tailwind/Material UI

📣 Phase 5: Alerting System
✅ Step 7: Slack/Email Alerts
Use Slack Webhooks or SMTP to send alerts

Trigger when anomaly score exceeds threshold

Backend handles alert dispatch logic

☁️ Phase 6: Infrastructure (DevOps & Deployment)
✅ Step 8: Docker & Kubernetes
Dockerize backend, frontend, Kafka simulator

Deploy with Kubernetes

Use Helm chart or Kubernetes manifests

✅ Step 9: CI/CD
GitHub Actions for testing, linting, and building Docker images

Push to AWS ECR or Docker Hub

Auto-deploy to EKS or GKE

📈 Phase 7: Enhancement (Post-MVP)
Once MVP is solid:

Replace Kafka simulator with real-time event stream (like AWS Kinesis or Kafka Connect)

Add LSTM for sequence modeling of behavior

Enable audit logs & role-based dashboards

Federated learning for privacy-aware threat detection
